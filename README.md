# Its-A-Start 03/27/22
A Discord Bot developed as an introduction to not only how Discord bots work, but as my first step into learning Python. 

This code was programmed in Repl.it, so some of the things included may not work on just any IDE. 
This bot is very basic for right now; it only has a functionality for inspiring quotes because i also had to learn what API's were
Also was developing functionaity for users to add and delete quotes from the list

The eventual purpose of this bot will be to, at its core, be a productivity bot for Discord so my nightowl-degen friends can get stuff done;
the bot was dev'd for a hackathon after quite a few decision changes of what to submit, but this actually functions so I'm going  to run with this

SO

when it runs in Repl.it, the bot will be active; I have yet to implement any sort of constant uptime activity, but that willprobably be one of the next thing i do
When it runs in the server =s it becomes a part of, it responds to a few commands:

$hello - The Bot will greet you back
$inspire - The bot will display a random inspirational quote from zenquotes.io

it also will encourage you if you mention the words "sad", "depressed", "unhappy", "angry", or "miserable". It does not detect context though, so if you put 
"I am NOT sad," it will trigger the function.
